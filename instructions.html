        <p> Password is a cooperative guessing game where teams of two take turns trying to guess a word (the
            "password") by
            giving one-word hints to their teammates. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Split into teams of two.</li>
            <li>Half of the players look at the password (one player from each team).</li>
            <li>Pick a team to go first and start the timer.</li>
            <li>Give a one word hint to your teammate and have them guess before the timer runs out.</li>
            <li>If your teammate guesses incorrectly, it's the next team's turn. Restart the timer.</li>
            <li>Continue taking turns until someone guesses correctly.</li>
            <li>If your teammate guesses correctly, click "Got it!".</li>
            <li>Switch the guessers and knowers after each round.</li>
            <li>First team to ten wins.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Example: Mohammed and Steve are on Team 1 and Pablo and Jessica are on Team 2. In round 1, Mohammed and
            Pablo
            are the guessers and Steve and Jessica are the knowers. The knowers, Steve and Jessica, look at the
            password,
            which is "Miami". Steve gives a one-word hint ("Scarface") for the password to Mohammed. Mohammed guesses
            "Tony
            Montana", he is wrong. Now it is Team 2's turn. Pablo gives Jessica the hint "Vice". Jessica guesses
            "Miami",
            she is correct, Team 2 gets a point. For the next turn, Mohammed and Pablo are the knowers and Steve and
            Jessica
            are the guessers.
